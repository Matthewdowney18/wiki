# Usage

To add/update this wiki, simply push `Edit on GitHub` button in the top-right corner. You have to be a part of [github.com/text-machine-lab](https://github.com/text-machine-lab) in order to push directly into the master branch and this is a recommended way to do it. The website is automatically updated after a push to the repository, so you don't need to do anything else (just to wait about a minute or so).

We prefer Markdown over reStructuredText text in this wiki ([cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), [How to use Markdown for writing Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/how-to-write-use-markdown)) as it is simpler to start with and we want to encourage you to help us maintain this wiki up to date.

However, do not update either of `make.bat`, `index.rst`, `history.rst`, `conf.py` or `Makefile` without knowing how Sphinx works and what you are actually doing.

### Maitainer info
