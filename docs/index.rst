   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Read the Docs Template's documentation!
==================================================

This is Text Machine Lab wiki. Hopefully, all information about servers setup, student guides, FAQ (how to update CUDA, etc.) will be placed here.

Please, use it. We do need a common place to share structured info.

Recommendations:

* *Bad article is better than no article.*
* Keep wiki structure as flat as possible, max depth of 2 covers 99% of all cases. 
* Use markdown syntax to make your post better formatted.
* Grammarly is a good resource to check your writing before submission
