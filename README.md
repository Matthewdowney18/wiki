# Usage

Webpage: [text-machine-wiki.readthedocs.io](https://text-machine-wiki.readthedocs.io)

To add/update this wiki, simply push Edit on GitHub button in the top-right corner. You have to be a part of github.com/text-machine-lab in order to push directly into the master branch and this is a recommended way to do it.

Do not update either of `make.bat`, `index.rst`, `history.rst`, `conf.py` or `Makefile` without knowing how Sphinx works and what you are actually doing.

Good example of Sphinx usage (and common python practices) can be found [in this project](https://github.com/audreyr/binaryornot).
